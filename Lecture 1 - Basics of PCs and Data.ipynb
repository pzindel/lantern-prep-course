The abacus, dating back to 2500 BCE, was such a device that allowed the user to quickly perform addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and store a numerical value. Since such mechanical devices were more efficient at specialized tasks they gained traction and advancements over the millenia until 1822 when Charles Babbage designed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine\">first programmable mechanical computer</a> the could utilize punch cards.</p>\n",

Post-WWII the discovery of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_computer\">smaller viable electrical components</a> help propel the production of consumer computers which have made incremental advancements since.</p>\n",

The various hardware components that they're composed of <em>allow</em> them to perform these task, and the programs written by programmers tell them <em>how</em> to perform the tasks. Data is provided as input, either from stored data or from a user, and then the computer follows a series of \"code\" instructions for tasks to perform with the data. Each instruction is a simple mathematics calculation that changes the currently held data and at the end the resulting data is either returned to the user (such as an image or text) or placed into storage for future usage.</p>\n",

    "            <p>It's possible for a system to have insufficient RAM when running a program. This mainly occurs for two reasons: the program is processing data that is too large to fit into RAM, or there is a memory leak. Since RAM is a limited and shared resource it is quite common to run into the first reason. The system RAM is divided among running programs and if a program is trying to request more RAM than available the system will refuse the request. Similarly, a program may continuously load new data into RAM and if there's a memory leak the unsed RAM is not being properly released back to the system for reallocation. This means the program continues to use more and more RAM until there is none left and the request is refused.</p>\n",
    "            <p>When a RAM request is refused due to insufficient resources, the OS and the program typically give the user an error to report the mistake. However since RAM is required for the system and programs to function, when the RAM is at 100% usage the system or program may just stop responding and crash.</p>\n",
    "            <p>The correct management of RAM is of particular interest to software developers and data scientist. When developing a user application, a software developer should strive to make the program as RAM efficient as possible to ensure that users can utilize the application on a wider range of devices without any resource issues. Data scientists should also be wary of high RAM usage that occurs when they wish to work with large amounts of data. Whenever the data scientist is working with the data directly is needs to be loaded into RAM which can be limiting. There are methods to help combat such issues such as loading data in more managable batches and then unloading before processing the next batch.</p>\n",

    "        <p>Moving up to level 6 of the system design we have programming languages and APIs. This is just one level down from where most end-users work from. On this level, software developers work to design applications and data scientists create programs to efficiently process data.</p>\n",
    "        <p>The programs can be written using a variety of different programming languages and interfacing with various OS-level APIs and internet-accessed APIs. The programming languages themselves have different levels of abstraction depending on the language syntax and how much control a programmer has over the system resource allocation. From a higher-level point of view, it doesn't matter which programming language is used to control the program and PC since all programs need to be translated into assembly and machine code for a computer to run it.</p>\n",

    "        <div style=\"padding: 0% 5% 0% 5%\">\n",
    "            <p>Programming languages are typically split into two categories: interpreted languages, and compiled languages. High-level languages such as Python and Javascript fall under the former and low-level languages like C and C++ fall under the latter.</p>\n",
    "            <p>Interpreted languages are languages whose instructions can be run as their are being read by the system. In other words the system translates a line of the program into machine code and executes the instruction before translating the next line. This method of running a program makes it easier to develop and test while also increase the programs cross-platform capability. However, if we wish to run the program multiple times, the code needs to be translated each time. This also means interpreted languages are often slower to run.</p>\n",
    "            <p>Compiled languages on the other hand, are translated into machine code all at once and packaged into a new program file (e.g. .exe file) that is ready to run. That means when the program (source code) is compiled you can quickly run it multiple times with having to translate and compile the program each time. The drawback of this method is that the program needs to be recompiled with modified instructions if we wish to execute it on a different machine. Only the source code can be edited, not the .exe file.</p>\n",
    "            <p>The primary tradeoff between high-level and low-level languages is the amount of control over the system's hardware. High-level languages offer syntax that is closer to human languages making it easy for programmers to understand. Additionally, they often provide built-in functions and libraries to programmers that handle many basic, and some complex, tasks that programmer may wish to do. Low-level languages may be harder to understand and offer more limited ready-to-use functionality but at the great benefit of giving programmer control over hardware resources which allow programs to be more efficient and faster.</p> \n",
