The editor should open the text file which may already contain some text or be completely empty.

    "        <p>To use Jupyter Notebook you need an up-to-date browser (as mentioned in section 1.4) to properly render the user interface and functionality. You can launch Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator or through a Bash terminal using the command <code style=\"DarkGreen\">jupyter notebook</code> and it will open the program dashboard in your default web browser.</p>\n",
    "        <p>The Notebook dashboard will allow you to navigate your file directory and perform basic file management task such as duplicating, renaming, moving, and deleting. In this dashboard you will be able to create new notebook files and load present notebooks for viewing and editing. The program uses the .ipynb format for its notebook documents. Jupyter Notebook also allows users to view other files directly from the dashboard and edit basic text files.</p>\n",

    "        <p>The notebooks are broken down into modular cells that allow you to write and run code one block at a time. There are two main types of cells: code and markdown. The code cells are where you will be writing you Python code and the markdown cells are where you will be able to place formatted narrative text and HTML (along with LaTeX formatted equations). When a cell is in edit mode it will be indicated by a green outline and a small pencil icon on the top right of the interface. When a code cell is executed it will display any printed output in the space below the cell.</p>\n",

Note that this is not true across different notebooks, i.e. any data and variables that we wish to use in the current notebook must also be defined in the current notebook or in an imported file/library.</p>\n",
    "        <p>The benefits provided by the Jupyter Notebook environment comes from the ability for users to interlace their code cells with the markdown cells, and also run code in a modular fashion with output values being printed after each cell as it's executed. This feature is particularly useful for those wishing to perform data analytics in Python as users can get continuous feedback on their code and the current state of the program. It simplifies the data exploration and plotting processes. Additionally, users are able to make note of their observations and conclusions in markdown cells as they progress through their workflow.</p>\n",

The application doesn't allow users to add well formatted markdown and equations inbetween their code, however the usual coding comment methods are still available for use.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Spyder's user interface provides three main windows: the editor (left), the object inspector (top right), and the console (bottom right). Within the editor window users will be able to select different scripts and write their code inside of them in a single block. The current script can then be run using the hotbar at the top which will execute the chosen program in the console window and will display any console output along the way. Any objects and variables that are loaded into memory by the program can be explored using the top right window.</p>\n",

    "        <p>Since Spyder is formatted like a traditional IDE its intended use is also for more traditional programming. Programs are written in files, containing only Python code, which can be run from any Python console or program. The code is written all in a single cell and any time you execute a script in Spyder, all lines of code in the file are executed (versus Jupyter Notebook's more modular execution).</p>\n",
    "        <p>The programming style that Spyder caters to is that which is more typically used for software development rather than data analysis. Furthermore, Spyder benefits over Jupyter through its build-in debugger which allows you to step through your program, one line at a time, and figure out where any mistakes are occuring.</p>\n",

    "        <p>The third option we have for programming in Python is to use a text editor to write our code and the command-line interface (CLI) to execute our scripts. This method of programming is similar to using Spyder but without any of the extra tools. As a result, this method is less suited to writing long and intricate programs since debugging code and fixing mistakes can be a more difficult process.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Using Python through the CLI bring us two main benefits. If we wish to write a short Python script to prototype or complete a simple task than using the CLI can be a quick and easy method for doing so. The second, and main, benefit of using the CLI is when it comes time to run Python scripts. When properly utilized, the CLI allows users to provide extra inputs that can alter the way Python programs run (assuming the program was written in a way to handle the given extra input). This is also useful when you wish to automate a process and have outputs from one program be used as inputs in another program, which is something is outside of the intended scope of Spyder.</p>\n",
    "        <p>To start writing Python code, you can open up a Python file with your preferred text editor using the command <code style=\"color:DarKGreen\">nano my_script.py</code> (in this case <em>nano</em> is the editor being used and <em>my_script.py</em> is the Python file I want to code in). This will open the file an allow you begin programming. Once you are finished and have saved and exited the text editor, you can run the new Python script from the command-line using the code <code style=\"color:DarkGreen\">python my_script.py</code>. Note: in some cases the alias for calling Python is <code style=\"color:DarkGreen\">python3</code>.</p>\n",
    "        <p>While in the command-line, you can also just call <code style=\"color:DarkGreen\">python</code> without a script to open an interactive Python interpreter that will allow you to run Python code one line at a time. Be aware that any code you write directly in the interpreter like this will be lost once you exit the interpreter.</p>\n",
