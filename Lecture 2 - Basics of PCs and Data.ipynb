This mainly occurs for two reasons: the program is processing data that is too large to fit into RAM, or there is a memory leak. Since RAM is a limited and shared resource it is quite common to run into the first reason. The system RAM is divided among running programs and if a program is trying to request more RAM than available the system will refuse the request. Similarly, a program may continuously load new data into RAM and if there's a memory leak the unsed RAM is not being properly released back to the system for reallocation. This means the program continues to use more and more RAM until there is none left and the request is refused.</p>\n",

When developing a user application, a software developer should strive to make the program as RAM efficient as possible to ensure that users can utilize the application on a wider range of devices without any resource issues. Data scientists should also be wary of high RAM usage that occurs when they wish to work with large amounts of data. Whenever the data scientist is working with the data directly is needs to be loaded into RAM which can be limiting.

    "            <p>Interpreted languages are languages whose instructions can be run as their are being read by the system. In other words the system translates a line of the program into machine code and executes the instruction before translating the next line. This method of running a program makes it easier to develop and test while also increase the programs cross-platform capability. However, if we wish to run the program multiple times, the code needs to be translated each time. This also means interpreted languages are often slower to run.</p>\n",

The drawback of this method is that the program needs to be recompiled with modified instructions if we wish to execute it on a different machine. Only the source code can be edited, not the .exe file.</p>\n",
    "            <p>The primary tradeoff between high-level and low-level languages is the amount of control over the system's hardware. High-level languages offer syntax that is closer to human languages making it easy for programmers to understand. Additionally, they often provide built-in functions and libraries to programmers that handle many basic, and some complex, tasks that programmer may wish to do. Low-level languages may be harder to understand and offer more limited ready-to-use functionality but at the great benefit of giving programmer control over hardware resources which allow programs to be more efficient and faster.</p> \n",
